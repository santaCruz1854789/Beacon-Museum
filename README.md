## Project Overview

### Objectives
1. Design an app that applies principles of **human-computer interaction (HCI)**, including:
   - User-centered design
   - Hands-on experience with the Agile Software Development Life Cycle Approach
   - Accessibility and usability testing
2. Deliver a proof-of-concept prototype that showcases the integration of beacon technology and user-driven features.

### Workflow
Our design and development followed these structured steps:
1. **Needfinding:** Conducted interviews and surveys with visitors and museum guides to identify key needs:
   - Better access to detailed artwork information
   - Social features for sharing opinions
   - Digital maps for seamless navigation
2. **Task Analysis:** Defined critical user tasks, such as locating artworks, leaving comments, and navigating maps.
3. **Prototyping:**
   - Created low-fidelity paper prototypes for early-stage testing.
   - Developed high-fidelity prototypes using Adobe XD.
4. **Evaluation:**
   - Conducted usability testing with cooperative evaluation methods.
   - Improved the app based on user feedback and iterative testing.
5. **Final Revision:** Implemented improvements including Material Design principles and enhanced user feedback mechanisms.
