# Beacon Museum

**Beacon Museum** is an academic project for the purpose of giving us a hands-on experience in developing interactive applications by applying principles of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). 
The project focuses on the **process of designing, prototyping, and evaluating a user-centered application** while introducing a proof of concept to modernize meum visits through the use of *Beacon Bluetooth* technology.

## Educational Objectives

This project was developed as part of the **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** course at Sapienza University of Rome, with the primary aim of:
1. Understand and apply **HCI principles**, including user-centered design and iterative development such as the **Agile Software Development Life Cycle Approach**.
2. Gain hands-on experience in:
   - Conducting **needfinding** through interviews and surveys.
   - Creating low-fidelity and high-fidelity **prototypes**.
   - Evaluating usability through **user testing** and feedback loops.
3. Learn how to design, build, and validate an application by following structured workflows and short development cycles.

The app idea—Beacon Museum—served as a vehicle for applying these concepts in a realistic and engaging context.

## Learning Outcomes

Through this project, our team gained practical experience in:
- **User-Centered Design:** Designing with a focus on the user's needs, behaviors, and feedback.
- **Iterative Development:** Implementing and refining features over multiple development cycles.
- **Prototyping Tools:** Using tools like Adobe XD to simulate and test app functionality.
- **Usability Testing:** Learning how to collect and analyze user feedback to drive improvements.
- **Collaboration:** Working in a multidisciplinary team with defined roles and shared goals.

## Project Workflow

The development process was structured to maximize **learning outcomes**:
1. **Needfinding:**  
   Conducted interviews and surveys to understand user needs. Key takeaways included:
   - The desire for detailed and accessible artwork information.
   - The need for better museum navigation tools.
   - Interest in social features like comments and reviews.

2. **Task Analysis:**  
   Identified critical tasks users would perform, such as locating artworks, leaving comments, and navigating digital maps.

3. **Prototyping:**  
   - **Paper Prototypes:** Created low-fidelity sketches to test the basic flow of the app.
   - **Adobe XD Prototypes:** Developed high-fidelity digital prototypes for more detailed user testing.

4. **Evaluation:**  
   - Conducted usability tests using cooperative evaluation methods.
   - Implemented feedback from users to refine the app iteratively.

5. **Final Revision:**  
   Enhanced user interface and experience, following **Material Design** principles and making iterative improvements based on testing results.

## Design Iterations and Feedback

### Prototyping and Testing
- **Prototype 1:** 
  - Created initial designs and tested with participants via screen sharing.
  - Key findings: Improve map usability, clarify beacon functionality, and enhance intuitiveness.
- **Prototype 2:** 
  - Developed a more refined version using Material Design principles.
  - Added features such as clearer feedback alerts and enhanced navigation flows.

### Focus on Learning
The iterative process provided insights into:
- Recognizing and addressing usability challenges.
- Managing user feedback to refine app design.
- Adapting to new tools and design principles during development.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Prototyping:** Adobe XD
- **Survey and Feedback Collection:** Google Forms, Discord
- **Beacon Simulation:** Integrated into design for conceptual testing.

---

## Future Prospects
While the app's concept remains a proof of concept, the knowledge and skills gained through this project lay the foundation for future work in:
- Developing fully functional applications.
- Enhancing interactive and user-centered systems.
- Bridging technical implementation with user experience design.
